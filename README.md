Emotion Detection using Custom CNN
Dive into the nuances of human emotions with our Emotion Detection project. This repository houses a Jupyter Notebook (Emotion_Detection.ipynb) detailing the creation of a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to recognize and classify a range of human emotions from images.

Features
Custom CNN Architecture: Tailored convolutional neural network design optimized for emotion detection in images.
Detailed Model Training Process: Comprehensive walkthrough of the model training process, including data preprocessing, model building, and training.
Visualization Tools: Utilization of matplotlib for visualizing the training performance of the model.
Accuracy and Loss Metrics: Insightful analysis of the model's accuracy and loss metrics to evaluate performance.
Getting Started
To get this emotion detection model up and running, follow these instructions.

Prerequisites
Python 3.10
Familiarity with Jupyter Notebooks
Understanding of CNN and machine learning concepts
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine to get started:

```
git clone https://github.com/sushantkothari/Emotion-Detection.git
Open the Emotion_Detection.ipynb file in a Jupyter environment to view and run the cells.
```

Usage
The Jupyter/Google Colab Notebook is self-contained and includes all the necessary code to:

Load and preprocess the emotion dataset.
Construct and compile the custom CNN model.
Train the model with the dataset.
Evaluate the model's performance and visualize the results.
Simply follow the steps in the notebook to replicate the model training process or to use the model for your emotion detection tasks.
